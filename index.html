    <p>Anyone can make a beautiful, delectable strawberry chessecake like this one in just a few steps.</p>
    <img src="images/davenport.jpg" alt="Me, holding a small basket af ruby red strawberries that I just picked">
    <p>Picking the strawberries yourself provides for the best made-from-scratch experience. I picked these near Davenport Beach, but here is a <a href="https://www.pickyourown.org/CA.htm">list</a> of other places you can go in California. If you don't have the time of course, store bought strawberries will also do.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients You'll Need</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 sticks of 8oz cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2 cups crushed graham crackers</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup pureed strawberries</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced strawberries</li>
    </ul> 
    <h4>Instructions</h4>

    <p>2. Using a large mixing bowl and a stand mixer (a hand mixer will also work), combine cream cheese, sugar, milk and vanilla </p>
    <p>3. Add eggs one at a time, do not overmix. Then stir in the flour and baking powder.</p>
